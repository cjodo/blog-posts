# Neovim status plugin

I'm writing a status plugin similar to (cord.nvim)[https://github.com/vyfor/cord.nvim].

It will allow for displaying your current neovim status fully customizable.
Example:
<img width="534" height="345" alt="webcord" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7747b734-ea5c-467f-9007-90496866bc57" />

Please give me some ideas for features. It's still very much in development I just have a barebones example sending POST requests to a specified endpoint.
